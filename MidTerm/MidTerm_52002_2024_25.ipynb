Sort the resulting list by the absolute value of the change in the number of trees, and display the five species with the highest absolute change in the number of trees. Show the number of trees in 1995, in 2015 and the change for these species. Since the names sometimes differ between the years, use the uppercase version of `spc_latin` for each year. Then, merge the data using a `CROSS JOIN`, with the condition that the [`EDIT_DISTANCE`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#edit_distance) between the names is less than or equal to 2.\n",

        "##### Q3a Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Query**:\n",
        "1. **Subquery for Census Data in 1995** (`census_1995`):\n",
        "   - We extract the species names (`spc_latin`) from the `tree_census_1995` dataset and use the `UPPER()` function to convert them to uppercase for easier matching.\n",
        "   - We count the number of trees for each species in 1995 and group the results by the species name.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Subquery for Census Data in 2015** (`census_2015`):\n",
        "   - Similar to the previous subquery, we extract and count the number of trees for each species in 2015, grouping by the species name (also converted to uppercase).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Combining the 1995 and 2015 Data**:\n",
        "   - A `CROSS JOIN` is used to combine every row from `census_1995` with every row from `census_2015`. This is necessary because we need to compare each species from 1995 with each species from 2015. The `CROSS JOIN` produces a Cartesian product of the two subqueries.\n",
        "   \n",
        "4. **Using `EDIT_DISTANCE` for Name Matching**:\n",
        "   - Since the species names may differ slightly between the two years (e.g., spelling variations), we use the `EDIT_DISTANCE()` function to match species names that are similar. We only include pairs of species whose names have an edit distance of 2 or less, which indicates a small difference (i.e., slight spelling discrepancies).\n",
        "   \n",
        "5. **Calculating the Change in the Number of Trees**:\n",
        "   - The query computes the absolute difference between the number of trees for each species in 1995 and 2015. This is stored as `change_in_trees`.\n",
        "   \n",
        "6. **Sorting and Limiting**:\n",
        "   - The results are ordered by the absolute change in the number of trees (`change_in_trees`) in descending order to identify the species with the highest changes. The query then limits the results to the top 5 species with the largest change.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Interpretation of Results**:\n",
        "- The table displays the **species** of trees, along with the number of trees in **1995** and **2015**, and the **absolute change** in the number of trees between these two years.\n",
        "- For example, **ACER PLATANOIDES** had 109,325 trees in 1995, but this number dropped to 34,189 in 2015, resulting in a decrease of 75,136 trees. This is the largest change among the species in this table.\n",
        "- On the other hand, **PYRUS CALLERYANA** saw an increase in the number of trees from 31,295 in 1995 to 58,931 in 2015, with a change of 27,636 trees.\n",
        "- **ZELKOVA SERRATA** experienced a significant increase in tree numbers as well, growing from 5,740 trees in 1995 to 29,258 in 2015, an increase of 23,518 trees.\n",
        "- Other species, such as **ACER SACCHARINUM** and **QUERCUS PALUSTRIS**, show different growth patterns, with some having notable declines or increases in tree numbers."
